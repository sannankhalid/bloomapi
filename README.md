BloomAPI
========

BloomAPI was originally this open source project. While BloomAPI is now a company with a different focus, this project is still actively maintained as set of libraries and executables to translate existing datasources into performant APIs. More information can be found at https://github.com/sannankhalid/bloomapi/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md.

To get a locally running copy of BloomAPI (only prerequisite is Docker with 4GB+ of memory -- if you are on a mac, you have to set this under docker preferences->advanced). We'd recommend running in production with at least 16GB of memory -- that said, it might work fine with less:

1. Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sannankhalid/bloomapi/master/docker-compose.yml
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` from the same directory

Data loading will happen automatically. You can view the progress of the initial data load with `docker-compose logs -f`. Once the initial data load is complete, test the API via http://localhost:3005/api/search/usgov.hhs.npi.

Code is also available for the current publically hosted datasources at https://github.com/bloomapi/datasources. This includes the NPI, ICD9, ICD10, PECOS and others.

Today, BloomAPI is focused on simplifying the way medical data is shared through technical and non-technical means. For more information about BloomAPI the company, see https://www.bloomapi.com.
